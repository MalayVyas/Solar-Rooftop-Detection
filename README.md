# Rooftop Detection Using Satellite Images

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting rooftops in satellite images using computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model to identify and segment rooftops from high-resolution satellite imagery. This can be useful for urban planning, disaster management, and various other applications.
