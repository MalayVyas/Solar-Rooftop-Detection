# Rooftop Detection Using Satellite Images

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting rooftops in satellite images using computer vision techniques. The primary goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model to identify and segment rooftops from high-resolution satellite imagery. This can be useful for urban planning, disaster management, and various other applications.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rooftop-detection.git
   cd rooftop-detection
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the rooftop detection model, follow the steps below:

Prepare the Dataset:
Ensure that you have the satellite images in a folder named data/images.

Run the Model:

bash
Copy code
python detect_rooftops.py --input_dir data/images --output_dir results
View Results:
The detected rooftops will be saved in the results directory. You can visualize the results using any image viewer.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of high-resolution satellite images. You can download a sample dataset from this link. Place the images in the data/images directory.

Model
This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for rooftop detection. The model is trained using the satellite images dataset and is designed to accurately segment rooftops from the images.

Training the Model
To train the model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --data_dir data/images --epochs 50
Adjust the parameters as needed.

Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting rooftops from satellite images. Below are some sample results:
